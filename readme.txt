= Can I use Theasys Plugin without an account on Theasys.io? =
No. You can install the plugin, but you will not be able to use it without an API Key. Only Theasys.io registered users can generate an API Key.

= I have changed my Virtual Tour's name or Embed name through my account on Theasys.io. What will happen if I have already used it in Wordpress? =
Nothing will happen. It will keep running without requiring any further action from your side.

= I have unpublished an embed through my account on Theasys.io, but I already use it as an embed in Wordpress. What will happen? =
The embed in Wordpress will stop playing your Virtual Tour. Instead a custom page will show with a message that this Embed has been unpublished.
